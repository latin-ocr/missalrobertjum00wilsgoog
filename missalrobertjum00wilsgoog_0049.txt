that' of Menard's Sacramentary by the columns of the Bene·
dictine edition of S. Gregory, and in that of the Leofric Missal‚
by the pages of Mr. Warren's edition.

With regard to the general arrangement of the text it
may bo well to point out that the Jumieges MS. is arranged
on the same lines as the Leofric M issal, in which it may be said
that the T emporale and Sanctorale form distinct sections, The
Sacramentaries of Muratori and Menard follow another plan,
blending in one series the two divisions of the Proprrum

which formed part of Alcuin's compilation, have not been fuscd

the Agnus Dei, some additions have been made by a later hand.
ln the Codex Ottobom'auus a clause beginning Memento mei,
similar t0, but not exactly agreeing with, that which forms part

of the Canon in Gem., has been added in the margin by a later
hand. ,

In the contents of the T emporale Gem. and Leofr. are for the
most part in agreement, except for the fact that Leofr. generally
has, while Gem. very frequently has not, an Oratio super populum
as part of its masses. Where both have a Super Populum itis
often the case that the prayer in one text is not the same as ¹
that in the other. Α proper Preface occurs in almost every
mass in the Τ emporale of Gem., and these are generally the
