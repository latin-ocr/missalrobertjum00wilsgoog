xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

if the purpose of the mention of the English saint had been to
adapt the Canon for the use of Ely. A more probable view of
the matter appears to be that the presence of S. Gertrude's
name is due to the intluence of a foreign sacramentary, and that„
the presence of S. Etheldreda's name is due to a desire, dictatcd
hy English sentiment, to balance the mention of a foreign saint
by the mention of an English one.¹ ll the mention of S.
Gertrude were due to local veneration os the saint either in the
place where the book was written or in that for which it was
intended, we should expect to find her commemorated also in‘
the Kalendar or in the Proprium: and S. Gertrude's name is
not in either of these parts of the Jumieges MS. But the
personal influence os the first abbot, or the influence of a text
of the Canon introduced by him, or by some one else, at an
early period of the history of a monastery, might well account
for the mention of a foreign saint in the Canon as used in an
English house: and it is by no means unlilrely that S. Grim-
bald, coming as he did from Flanders, where S. Gertrude was
perhaps the principal local virgin saint, brought with him to
New Minstera text of the Canon which contained her name.
Whether such a text was followed in the mass-books of New
Minster asa rule, or whether her name appeared at all commonly
in books written in that house, we have no means ofjudging. But
it is extremely probable that if the text of New Minster regularly
contained her name, the name of an English saint would be
joined with it: and the name of S. Etheldreda was perhaps the
most likely English name to be chosen for such a purpose.

One more pointwhich might seem to furnish evidence of
locality perhaps calls for a word of notice. ln the series of ·
prayers for use in various parts of the monastery there is one,

¹ Α point, which may be really quite insignificant, may yet have some weight in
support of the suggestion that the one name has, in some such way as this, brought in
the other. The names should, grammatically, be in the ablative case, but as they
stand in the manuscript the name of S. Etheldreda is certainly in the genitive. This
may, of course, bea very simple clerical error: buton the other hand it may be due
to the fact that the name of S. Gertrude has a form which (though itis possibly an
ablative‚ Geretrudis being treated as indeclinahle) certainly looks like agenitive‚ and

might very well have leda scribe who intended to prefix S. Etheldreda's name in the
same case as the name of S. Gertrude to write Aetheldrythae.
