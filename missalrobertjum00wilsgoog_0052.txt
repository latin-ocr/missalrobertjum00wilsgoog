xlvi INTRODUCTION.

in each case of a Super Populum.1 In Men. the masses for
these Sundays have a larger Gelasian element than those in
Gem. Mur. or Leofr.

The Lent masses of Gem. are for the most part in agreement
with those of Leofr. and Mun, but there are some exceptions‚
chiefly, as might be expected, in the masses of the Thursdays.
In Men. the Lent masses are apparently influenced to some
extent by those of the Gelasian books of the type of R and S.
The Ash Wednesday mass of Gem. agrees with that of Mur.
with the addition of the Preface given in (Mur.) and Ott. In
Leofr. a Super Populum is also added. The Thursday mass of
Gem. has no Super Populum, but otherwise agrees with Mur.
Leofr. The Friday mass agrees with Mur. Leofr. differs only
in the Postcornmunion, employing the sarne prayer which is
found in R and S. For the Saturday Mur. and Men. provide
no mass. Gem. and Leofr. both follow to some extent the
Gelasian books, but while Leofr. takes the second Collect of
V, R, S, Gem. takes the first. Both take the Gelasian Secret
and Postcommunion, while Gem. has the Super Populum
assigned to the Thursday in Mur. Leofr. Men.

The first Sunday of Lentis in Mur. provided with prayers
Ad Vesperos and Ad Fontes. Leofr. etnploys the second 0f these
as the Super Populum of the mass, while Gem. places the collect
Ad Vesperos as its Super Populum and discards the collect Ad
Fontes. ln the Preface Gem. and Leofr. agree with Ott, not
using the Preface given in (Mur.) for the Initircm Quadragesimue.
The week-day masses of Gem. from Monday to Friday inclusive
agree with Leofr. and with Mur, except that the Prefaces are
not found in the latter text: these are the sameas in Ott. For
the Sabbatum in xii Lectionibus Gem. agrees with Mur. in the

¹ That for septuagesima is the first collect of the mass in V R and S. Those for
Sexagesima and Quinquagesima are also in these Gelasian books, in the same position
which is given to thern in Leofr. It may be worth while here to notice a difference
in arrangement between Leofr. and Gem. The former places in the T carpende, while
the latter places in the Sarrclorale‚ the festivals of the Purification (see p. lviii. infra)
and the Annunciation. The masses for these days. with one for the Vigil of the
Purification, are placed in Leofr. before the mass of Septttagesima On the other

hand Gem. places before the mass of Ash Wednesday forms for the Benediction of the
ashes, which are not contained in Leofr. A.
