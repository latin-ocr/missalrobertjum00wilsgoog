lii INTRODUCTION.

Making this allowance, it will be found that the first sixteen
masses of Gem. agree in the Collect, Secret‚ and Postcommunion
with the first sixteen of (Mun), the Prefaces agreeing with
those of Ott. The same amount of agreement may be observed
in Leofr. while Men. is generally in agreement. though it shows
some variations from (Mur.) and Ott. even where Leofr. and
Gem. agree. But Leofr. Men. Gem. all have, in these masses, a
Super Populum while they do not always agree in their selection.
ln Leofr. the prayer employed for this purpose is most often
one os the Collects in the corresponding mass of the later
Gelasian books. Gem. on the other hand sometimes seems to
draw upon a Gelasian collection of Benedictiones Super Populum
like those which in V and S follow the Conon fictionis,l and
sometimes employs a form which appears among the series of
select collects in (Mun).

The 17th of the Sunday masses in Gem. Leofr. corresponds
not with the 17th os the series in (Mur.) but with the mass for
the Sunday preceding the Ember Days of September, con·
tained in Mur. The Preface agrees with that in Ott. where the
Prefaces for the Ember Days follow closely. The Super
Populum in Leofr. does not agree with that of Gem., the former
having the second Collect of the mass in R and S, the latter
one of the series in the Gelasian books, The masses for the fol·
lowing weelr-dayS, and the prayers of the Sabbatum in ,πῖ
Loctt'om'bus are the same in Gem. and Leosr., except that Gem.
has a Super Populum in each mass: the Collects, Secrets, and
Postcommunions agree with Mun, the Prefaces with Ott.

The mass for the next Sunday in Leofr. has the Collect
assigned in Mur. to the “Douu‘m'ca vocot,'' following in this
respect, and also in the Secret, Prefaceand Postcommunion, the
mass for the “Domim'ca vacat'' in R and S, from the second
Collect of which it takes its Sopor Populum.² Men. follows the

¹ The cases in which Gem. employs a form included in the Gelasian series of

. Postcommunions‚ and not found in (Mur.) are sufficiently numerous to warrant the

supposition that this has been the cose. It is not unlikely that the series of Berre-
dlclr'oncs in S was at least as full as that in V, and the whole of the collects selected
in Gem. may have been found in the series of some other Gelasian MS.
