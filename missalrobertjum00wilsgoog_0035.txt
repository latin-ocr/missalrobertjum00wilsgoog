S. Birinus, two oi S. Ethelwold. We might expect that some
note of the festivals oi S. Swithun would appear in a Winchester
Kalendar, even though it were not that of the Old Minster:
and hence the number ol these entries, perhaps, is less to be
considered than the relative prominence given to the festivals.
None of them is specially marked by gold letters in thc
Kalendar: this distinction, indeed, is given to few of the English
saints ;l but had the book been written in S. Swithun's Minster
he would surely have received from the scribe some share of
such honour. As it is, there is nothing in the Kalendar to
indicate that any one of the three festivals ol S. Swithun was ol
high rank, while only one os them has a proper mass in the
Sanctorale. The case is the same with the two festivals of
Α S. Birinus. Thus, taking the Kalendar and the Propn'um
together, we lind that the prominence given to these two saints,
especially venerated in the Old Minster, is less than we might
loolr ior in a manuscript written in that house. They are indeed
distinguished, but not more than we might naturally expect in a
book written in any of the monasteries in Winchester. On the
other hand we find that the Proprium provides aproper mass
for each of the two festivals of S. Ethelwold,to whom the monks
of the New Minster owed an especial reverence: while we lind
also in the Kalendar, though not in the Proprium, the mention
of S. Grimbald, the original abbot of New Minster.²

With regard to the prominence given to the saints oi Ely, it
may be said that it is less than we should expect is the book had,
as M. Pottier supposes been written for use in that monastery.
Several of them appear in the Kalendar, audone festival of

¹ S. Edward, S. Angustiae, S. Cuthbert are entered in gold uncials, S. Etheldrtda
(June 23) and S. Ethelwold (Aug. 1) in gold rustic capitals, S. Tibba in grld
minuscules. The last distinction is probably due to the fact that the entry follows
closely on the Christmas group of festivals, and S. Ethelwold appears in the same linc
and script asS. Peter ad Vincula.

²After the removal ol New hlinster to Hyde' rn 1110, S. Grimbald appearst
to have been regarded as one of' rts principal patrous: but' rt is quite possible that his
festival was not, even at New Minster, oi much rmportance at the time when the
hlS. was written. Another local festivalis perhaps indicated by the entry, on
llpr. 1, of the name of Borontus or Borontius: but l have failed to lind any evidence
as tothis saint or to discover his name in any other Kalendar. He was perhaps a
local ‘’'wortby rather thanasamt
