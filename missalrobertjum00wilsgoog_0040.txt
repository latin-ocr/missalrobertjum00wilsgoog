xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

the Missals ol' Sarum, York, and Hereiord. But in these books
a phrase in the secret, which was especially appropriate at
Rouen, and less appropriate elsewhere, has been changed. ln
the Jumieges MS. it stands unaltered.¹ The masses ol' S.
Vedast and S. Orner agree, so far as the collect, secret and
postcommunion are concerned,¹ with each other and also with

the mass of S. Augustine ol Canterbury. They differ only in
the substitution ol the name os the apostle ol one region sor that
ol the apostle of another. There is a slight incongruity in their
use in England ι they belong to Arras and to The'rouanne. as the
mass ol S. Augustine belongs to England. At what time they
were imported there is no means os knowing: they may have
been introduced at any time before the manuscript was written:
but it is perhaps natural to think that they are more likely to
have been introduced to an English monastery by one coming
from the district where they had their original and proper
significance than to have been adopted by an English com·
munity proprii> motu, and to see in them a trace os S.
Grimbald’s connection with Flanders on the one hand and New
Minster on the other.

lt has been already said that M. Pottier, in support ol' his
view that the manuscript was intended sor use in the monastery
of Ely, lays stress on the presence in the Canon oi the Mass and
in the Litany of the names os certain saints of Ely. The names
are those os SS. Etheldreda‚ Sexburga, Witburga, and Eormen·
hild. S. Etheldreda is mentioned in the Canon, together with
S. Gertrude, in the clause Nobis quoque pecccatoribus: and the
four are invoked among virgin saints, in the Litany.³ M. Pottier
speaks ol them as the first lour abbesses os Ely: but the case
is not quite as he supposed. S. Witburga (the sister ol SS.
Etheldreda and Sexburga and aunt ol S. Eormenhild) was

¹ At Rouen, S. Ouen would naturally be called patronus noster: at l'orlr and
Hereiord the words patroni nostri are changed to patroni sui (i.e., fidelis popuii),
while the Sarum hlissal substitutes confessoris tui atque pontificis.

² These three prayers make up the mass ol S. Omer. That os S. Vedast has a
presace, and has subjoined to it an oratio ad vesperum, which may be taken to
indicate that the festival wasone ol high rank.

³ All leur names, as we have seen, occur in the Kalendar oi the MS.
