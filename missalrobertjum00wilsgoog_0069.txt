agree with those ior the Vigil of SS. Simon and Jude, and the
Festival oi SS. Philip and James.1 The mass In Nat. Evange-
listarum appears in Leosr. (C), those Iu Nat. Unius iiartyrrs,
Iu Nat. Plur. Martyrum and In Nat. Plur. Corrscssorum all
appear in the Commune of (Mur), the two former also in
Leoir. (A).² That lu Vrg. Unius Confessorrs nearly agrees with
the mass sor the feast os a Confessor in (Mur.) :³ that ior the
vigil of several Confessors agrees with the massin Men. ln
several oi the masses oi the Commune it is possible to trace
resemblances to the Gelasian books: some appear there in
almost the same form, though two os these are in the Proprr'um,
not in the Commune os the Gelasian books⁴ The mass sor the
festival ol' the Dedication oi a church agrees closely with that
in Men, the Collect, Secret and Postcommunion are sound in
Leon. C 3ηά also (with the Super Populum) in (Mur). The
mass ior the anniversary os Ordination agrees, so iar as the
Collect, Secret,and Postcommunion are concerned, with a Misso
propria Pontificis in Ordi'namne ipsius which forms partos the
contents os Leol . C.

Temporole and Sanctorale os the Jumieges manuscript in some
detail, sor two reasons. In the first place, such an examination
gives ground sor the belief that wc have in this manuscript, as
in the·texts os Leosr. A and of Menard's Sacramentnry, an
example of the manner in which, in the tenth and eleventh
centuries, the contents oi the Roman Sacramentary represented
by Mur. were combined with the contents os Alcuin's supple·
ment, and with matter taken from the older mass-books oi the
Gelasian type. ln Menard's Sacramentary the Gelasian books
appear to have been more ireely employed than in Leos. A,

¹ The second oi these is also used in the Commuru ol (Mur.) and Leofr. (Al.

¹ These messes agree with those os S. Mennas, SS. Felicissimus and Agapitus,
and SS. l'rocessus and Martinianus, in the Proprium.
