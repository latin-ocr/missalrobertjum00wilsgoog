INTRODUCTION.

6. Benedictio salis et aquae followed by a series os prayers

for use in different parts of the monastery (pp.
27 5-280), and various benedictions (pp. 280-282).

7. The form ol admission ot a novice to monastic pro·
lession (pp. 282-286).

8. Mass lor the Sick, followed by the order sor the Visitation,
Unction, and Communion of the Sick, and another Mass
sor the sick (pp. 286-297).

9. Agenda mortuorum, including prayers for the Commen-
dation ol a departing soul, and the order ol Burial
(oo- 297-303)ο

ιο. Masses for the departed (pp. 303-310).

11. Masses pro vr'ois atqua defunctis (pp. 310-313).

12. A mass pro sacerdotibus, with lections, &c (pp.
313-315).

Of these sections the first is commonly found in Sacra-
mentaries os the date and character ol the Jumieges manuscript,
though with occasional differences os arrangement. Apart from
the presence of additional masses, already mentioned, it may be
observed that the allocation os the votive masses to particular
days does not agree with that of the series in the Leolric Missal.

The second section, again, is commonly represented in manu·
scripts os this class: but the order, number, and composition os
the masses may be said to vary a good deal. There is certainly
agood deal ol difference between this section ol the Jumieges
MS. and the parallel section os the Leolric Missal, or os
Muratori's text: but the majority os the prayers which make
up the masses in the first are sound in the parallel portions of
the other two.

The third sectionis made up ol three parts, all ol which
appear in the supplementary portion ol Muratori’s Sacramentary.
ln the Leolric Missal the forms lor Ash Wednesday and Coena
Domini are inserted in the T amporale, those sor a penitent at the
point os death in what may be called the supplementary part ol
the text

Os the fourth section, the form Ad alenam forandum,
the Oratio aa’ capillaturam and Oratio ad barbas tondendas
