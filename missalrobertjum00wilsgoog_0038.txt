According to this list the group of foreign saints is repre·
sented in the Jumieges MS. by eighteen or (if S. Amandus on
Oct. 26 is distinct from S. Amandus on Feb. 6) by nineteen
names, and by twenty-one festivals. Of the eighteen names the
Lotharingian Litany of the Leofric Missal contains all but three.
The Kalendar of the Leofric hfissal, which may be taken to
represent the usage of Exeter between 970 and 1000, includes
ten of the eighteen names, and as many of the twenty-one
festivals. On the other hand we see that in the 9th century,
before the influence of Alfred's introduction and promotion of
foreign clerks had made itself felt, the local Kalendar ol'
winchester, as represented by the Digby MS, already included
twelve out of the twenty-one festivals which represent the
foreign clement in the Jumieges book.

The additions, in fact, which have been made to the names
included in the older lVinchester Kalendar are not more
numerous than we might reasonably expect them to be if we
merely consider the interval of time between the probable dates
of the Digby and the Jumieges manuscripts. But it is worth
while to notice a few points which (on the hypothesis that the
Jumieges MS. was written in the New Minster} may be thought
to have some connection with the addition of particular names
The name of S. Judoc‚ there can be little doubt, was introduced
in consequence of the fact that in the year 903 the relies of the
saint were brought to England by refugees from Ponthieu, and
found a testing-place in the New Minster.³ The lists of relies

¹ These saints are in the Jnmieges MS. commemorated in the same mass with SS.
Remigius and Germanus.

² This saint is probably identical with S. Amandus of llaestricht, the founder of
S. Amand near unas The Litany of the leofric hlrssal has the name of
5. Amandus, like that of S. vedast, only once.
