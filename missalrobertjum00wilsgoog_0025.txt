lNTRODUCTlON.

THE Sacramentary known as the Missal of Robert of Jumieges,
of which the full text is now for the first time printed,¹ is one of
the fcw remaining English service books belonging to the period
before the Norman Conquest. lt owes its name to the fact that
it was given by Robert of Jumieges, while he was Bishop of
London, to be preserved as a memorial of himself in the chureii
of the monastery of Jumieges, over which he had formerly
presided as abbot. Robert himself was one of the Norman
ecclesiastics in favour with Edward the Confessor. He became
Bishop of London in 1044, and was advanced by the King to
the see of Canterbury when it became vacant by the death
of Eadsige in 1050. He was enthroned as Archbishop on
S. Pe'ter's Day, 1051, but his occupation of the primacy was
brief. ln the following year, when the Earls Godwin and
Harold returned from an exile for which he was mainly respon·
sible, he, with other Norman prelates, fled out of England, and
was outlawed by the “Witan,” and Stigand took possession of
the see of Canterbury. From William of Malmesbury' we learn
that Robert proceeded to Rome to appeal against his ejection
from the Archbishopric, and that he was on his way to England,
with letters from the Pope to secure his restoration, when he
died at Jumieges. He was buried in the church which he

had built, and to which he had given the book which bears
his name.
