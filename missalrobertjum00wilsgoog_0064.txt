lviii INTRODUCTION.

the reverse. For the festival of SS. Fabian and Sebastiam
where Mur. und Leolr. give the two masses separately, Gem.
combines them into one, placing the Collect for S. Sebastian
after that for S. Fabian, dic, but having only one Preface, that
for S. Sebastian. The mass for S. Gregory's day in Gem. agrees
with Leofr. in adding a Prelace, but differs from it and agrees
with Mur. in retaining what is probably the older forrn of the
Secret.¹ There are also some other minor differences; but it
may be said generally that in this group of masses the principal
variations which Gem. shows from the textos Mur. is to be
found in the addition of Prefaces3 and that in most cases Leofr.
agrees with Gern.

Menard’s Sacramentary contains masses for all the days of
this group: but its divergences frorn Mur. are more consider·
able. It may be observed that Gem. places before the mass of
the Purification forms for the Benedictio Carnorum. These do
not occur in Leofr. in the same position, or indeed at all in the
earliest part of the text of the Leofric Missal: but the sarne
prayers and anthems are provided in that portion of the text
which Mr. Warreu distinguishes as C, that is to say, in the part
of the Leofric Missal which appears to have been written in
England, during the eleventh century! The loss of a leaf in
Gem. unfortunately prevents us from knowing whether the agree·
ment extended to the rubric with which Leofr. C euds the
section.⁸

The third group of masses may be divided into two sections.
Of these the first consists' of 30 masses, in which Gem. agrees
wholly or partly with Leofr. A. They are those for the
following days :-

¹ This is in Mur. and Gem. a prayer for S. Gregory: n Leofr. it is converted
into a prayer for benefits by his intercession.

² Leostt‘t Missal, pp. 203-4.

⁸11 may be noticed that the Benedictio in Gem. follows immediately after the
collect of the mess of S. Brigid: while the Secret and Postcommunion of that mass
do not now appear. This would seem to suggest the possibility that the candles were
blessed during the mass of the day preceding the Purification‚ the Secret and Post·
communion being written at the close of the Benedictio, und having thus diseppeued
from Gem. by the loss of the leaf. Iaeofr. A hes no mess for S. Brigid¹sdcy.
