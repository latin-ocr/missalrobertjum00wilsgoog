INTRODUCTION. xxxi

English saints mentioned in the MS.-m0re notable, that is
to say, for our present purpose—the asterisk and “ obelus ”
have the same significance as before.l The letters which follow

the dates indicate the presence of the saint's name in the
Kalendar of the Bodleian MS. Digby 63 (D), in the Litany

contained in the original, or Lotharingian‚ portion of the Leofric
Missal (L 1) and in the Kalendar of the Leofric Missal, written
about 970 in England (L 2). The Digby MS. 63, which is
assigned to the middle of the 9th century‚² was written by a
priest of Winchester. Its Kalendar is therefore of special
importance for this comparison.

¹ Some other festivals seldom found, but hardly available as evidence of locality,
may be mentioned here. There isa mass for the festival of S. Basil‚ without date,
but probably pointing to a festival on Jan. 1. ln the Kalendar, S. Christina is
mentioned on July 19 and on Oct. 5, two entries which are represented also in the
. early Winchester Kalendar of MS. Digby 63. S. Benedict appears on Dec. 4,
where we lind a festival of the same saint mentioned in the rather later Winchester
Kalendars contained in the Cottonian MSS. Vitellius E. xviii. and Titus D. xxvii.
the latter of which seems to proceed from the New Minster.

² The Deposition of S. Swithun has been added to the Kalendar ol the MS. by a
later hand ; hence the Kalendar was probably written within a very few years of 863,
if not before that date. 1t may be considered that it is certainly earlier thau the date
of the foundation of the New Minster.

⁸ S. Radeguud was also connected with Noyon, having received consecratiou from
S. Medard.

⁴8. Samson probably owes his place in the Exeter Kalendar to his Celtic
nationality: he appears in the ninth century Kalendar of Amiens (see Delisle, Mlm.
srrrd'Ancr'ens Sacramentaires, p 336.)

⁵ This festival coincides with that of S. Bartholomew, which the Jumieges MS.
places on Aug. 25.
