lxviii INTRODUCTION.

this Introduction: it must suffice for our present purpose to
note the interest which attaches to it as an example of the forms
employed in England before the Norman Conquest.

The order for the Visitation and Unction of the Sick is
preceded by a mass pro rhfirrmh, agreeing in its prayers and
preface with one contained in the Leofric Missal.¹ The order
of Visitation and Unction is marked by the occurrence (peculiar
to this section of the manuscript) of vernacular rubrics.² Their
presence might suggest that the office in which they appear is
the most distinctiy English part of the contents of the book:
and it is therefore worth while to observe that the rubrics‚ which
present one or two rather unusual features, are in very close
agreement with the Latin rubrics of an Ordo printed by Martene
from a manuscript Pontifical‚ belonging to the Church of Cam-
brai, assigned by him to a date about the end of the 12th cen-
tury.³ With this Orda, moreover, the office of the Jumieges book
shows an amount of agreement which seems to suggest a close
relationship between the two, though the Ordo given by Martene
omits some of the prayers contained in the Jumieges manuscript.⁴
The Litany included in this office has already been mentioned.⁵
The office is followed by another mass pro infirmo, not contained
in Muratori’s text, or in the Leofric Missal, and by a series of
additional prayers which appears in the former, and of which
the component parts occur also in the latter, though in adifferent
order.⁰

² See pages 287-294 infra. A modern English version of the rubrics will be found
in an appendix to the present Introduction.

17⁶3·)

⁴ It may be worth while to note that the rubric of the Jumieges manuscript directs
that the sick person is to communicate in both kinds. The rubric of the Cambrai
Pontifical only directs that he is to communicate, while the words of administration
(which are not in the Jumi'eges MS.) point to communion in one kind. The prayer
after the communion, in both affice, speaks of him as receiving coeptu et sanguinem
Domini.

⁸ See pp. xxxiv. sqq. mpra

⁶ lt has already been stated that this section of the Jumitges his. and that which
follows it are not in agreement with the parallel porticus of the Winchester MS.
found by Mr. Warren in the Woreeater Chapter Library. (See note 3, on p. xxxvi.
