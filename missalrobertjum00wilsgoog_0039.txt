INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

possessed by New Minster which appear in the Register oi the
monasteryl mention also relics of three other saints whose
names appear in the Kalendar oi the Jumieges MS. but are
absent from the older Winchester Kalendar.² The mention of
S. Bavo‚ the patron of Ghent, on Oct. 1, together with SS.
Remigius, Germanus and Vedast,8 is probably rare in English
books. lt seems not altogether impossible that its introduction
may be connected with the fact that Womar, abbot ol Ghent,
appears to have been sor a time a visitor, or even an inmate, os
the New Minster.⁴

The proper masses for festivals belonging to this group
which appear in the Sanctorale are (is we include the mass in
which SS. Vedast and Bavo are commemorated on Oct. 1) five
in number. The mass sor Oct. 1 calls sor no special notice.
The other four are those os S. Genovesa (Jan. 3) S. Vedast
(Feb. 6) S. Ouen (Aug. 25) and S. Omer (Sept. 9).⁸ Save sor the ·
presence os a preface, the mass os S. Genovesa is the same as
that in the old Paris Missal, and the masses ol S. Vedast, S.
Ouen, and S. Omer appear, from internal evidence, to have been

taken, at second hand, it may be, but without change, from the
local mass-books os the districts to which the saints belonged.
The mass of S. Ouen, except the preface, has found its way into

Vitellius E. xviii. mark Jan. 9 as the day ol the Translation ol 8. Judoc,a festival
which is not noted in the Kalendar ol the Jumieges MS. Possibly this translation
may have been toa new shrine in the church oi the New Minster, andos adare later 3
than that of the Jumitges MS. ᾗ

¹ See pp. 147-53, 158-63 ol the Register.

² S. Genoveia, S. Radegund‚ and S. Leuthsred. The lists also include relies oi
three oi the saints oi this group who have a place in the Kalendar ol the Digby MS,
S. Vedast, S. Bertin‚ aud S. Firmin.

⁸ The Kalendar os the MS. only mentions SS. Remigius and Germanus. The
names oi SS. Vedast and Bavo appear in the heading and prayers ol the mass ior the
day in the Propriam Sanctorum (see p 216 infra.)

⁴ His name appears, with a note os some length, in the Register oi New Minster,
at the head oi a list oi those quise specialiter devoverunt. (Register, p. 24.) The
editor oi the Register seems to think that Womar remained at New Minster till his
death

⁸ S. Amandus, whose name is joined with that os S. Vedast in the Kalendar, is
uot mentioned in the Propn'um at all. There is also a discrepancy between the
Kalendar and the Proprium with regard to S. Ornet. The Kalendar only notra one
oi his festivals, (June 7) sor which the Proprium has no mass S. ouen does not
appear in the Kalendar at all.
