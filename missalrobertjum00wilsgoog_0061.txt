INTRODUCTION. lv

Pentecost) masses contained in Mur. have been
differently treated in the process ol combining the
Roman Sacramentary with the supplement.

2. That the differences between Leosr. and Gem. on the one
hand and Muratori’s Sacramentary on the other (as
concems masses common to the three) are generally
by way ol addition, while in Men. there is frequently a
difference by way os substitution also.

3. That as regards the Presaces added in Leofr. Gem. and
Men. these three books generally agree with each other
and with Ott.

4 That in the selection oi forms to serve as Orationes Super
Populum both Leosr. and Gem. have drawn, mediately
or immediately, from Gelasian Sacramentaries: but
the use made os these books has not been always the
same in the two cases.

5. That while, as regards this portion of their contents,
Leosr. and Gem. may be said to stand at about the
same distance lrom Muratori's Sacramentary‚ Men. is
rather further removed from it, and shows perhaps
more likeness to the Gelasian books than either Leolr.
or Gem.

Tne Snvcroanus.

ln considering the Proprium Sanctorum of Gem. we may
divide the masses which it contains into three groups :—

1. Those which are identical with the masses sor the same
days in Mur.

2. Those which are partially in agreement with the masses
sor the same days in Mur. but differ by additions or
in some detail.

3. Those sor days lor which no mass is provided in Mur.

The masses oi the first group are 31 in all. The list is as
follows:—

S. silvester. S vitalis.
S. Prisca SS. Alexander, Evenntius, and

S. Valentine. Theodulus
