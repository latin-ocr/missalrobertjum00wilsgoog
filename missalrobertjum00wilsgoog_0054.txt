xlviii INYRODUCTION.

Gem. lt may be noted that Leofr., like Gem., places before the
mass of Palm Sunday a form for blessing the palms: but the
form does not agree with the fragment of the Benedictio
Palmamm which remains in Gem.

ln the Good Friday prayers it may be remarked that Gem.
in the prayer “pro christianissimo imperatore,” reads “respice
ad A regiorum benignus imperium.” The form for the Benedictio
Cerei is that commonly found, agreeing (except for a few slight
variants) with Leofr. 3ηά the first of the two forms in (Mun).
The lessons and prayers before the Benedictio Fontis agree with
the order of Mun, not with the fuller order of Leofr. and
(hlur.): but the tracts Cantemus dorm'no and Vinea sacta est,
which Mur. does not mention, are indicated in Gem. The order
of Baptism, which Leofr. separates from the Terrqeomle follows
here in Gem., where it is preceded by the forms of benediction
and exorcism of the CatechumenS, and followed by forms for
clinical Baptism and for the reception as a catechumen of a
convert from heathenism. The former of these appears in the
same shape in (Illur.),¹ the latter in the Gelasian Sacramentarics
V and R!

ln the mass of Easter Day Gem. agrees with Ott. (Mur.)
and differs from hlur. Men. Leofr., in retaining the Gelasian
l'reface: it also has the Benedictio Carnis which is absent from
Mur. Men. Leofr. and from V and R, but appears in S. This
formis placed in Gem. aster the Postcommunion, but retains
the ending per quem haec onznia, indicating its original position
at the close of the Canon. Its text is practically the same as
that printed by Gerbert‚³ varying in one or two points from that
of S 2. The masses for the days of the weelc following Easter
are almost identical in Gem. Mur. Men. Leofr., the Prefaces in
Gem. Men. Leofr. agreeing with those in Ott.‚ not with the
series of Easter Prefaces in (Mun). Men. and Leofr. show
some divergenccs from the others in the messos Monday, while
