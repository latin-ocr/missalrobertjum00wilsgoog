INTRODUCTION.

early part of the tenth century‚.and was written in
Lotharingia. This he has distinguished as A, while
some additions written in England at different dates
he has distinguished as C. To avoid confusion, it will
be best to follow his notation, at least so far as to
distinguish the later English additions as Leofr. C.,
employing as a rule for the earliest portion of the book
the symbol Leofr.

iii. The Sacramentary edited by Menard and reprinted
in the Benedictine edition of S. Gregory¹s works.
This text (based on a ninth or tenth century MS.) will
be denoted by the symbol Men.

iv. The Jumiegcs MS. itself will frequently be denoted by
the symbol Gem.

Besides these texts, which all represent one type or another
of the Gregorian Sacramentary, it will sometimes be necessary
to refer to the Sacramentaries of the Gelasian class. F irst and
most important of these is the book commonly known as the
Gelasian Sacramentary, now in the Vatican Library: but the
resemblances which we may have occasion to notice are more
commonly to bc found in the later Gelasian Sacramentaries of
S. Gallen and Rheinau, used by Gerbert for his Monumenta
Veteris Liturgiae Alamannicus. For these books it may be best
to employ again the symbols by which they are denoted in the
recent edition of tbe Gelasian Sacramentary‚ and to distinguish
them by the letters V (Vatican MS.) R (Rheinau MS.) and
S (S. Gallen MS.) further distinguishiug, when necessary, the
original text of S as Sr and the text produced by a ninth·
century correction as S2. But the consideration of particular
readings will not be so minute as to require any large employ-
ment of the last distinction.

Where a reference is given to the printed texts it will
be given, in the case of Muratori‘s Sacramentary‚ and of the
Vatican text of the Gelasian Sacramentary, by the columns of
Muratori's Lt'turgr'a Romana Vetus in the edition of 1748,¹ in

¹These are marked in the margins of the Oxford edition of the Gelasian
Sacramentary.
