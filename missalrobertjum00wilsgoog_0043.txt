INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

There is one other name in the same litany which may seem
to call lor a word of explanation, though its presence gives no
indication oi the locality of the manuscript. Itis that os S.
Martialis, who is invoked immediately alter, and in conjunction
with, the Apostles and Evangelists. He is no doubt to be
identified with S. Martialis, the reputed first bishop ol Limoges,
sometimes called “the Apostle os the Limousin,'' whom Gregory
oi Tours mentions as one os the seven bishops sent irom Rome
to Gaul in the time os Decius. A legend later than that
recorded by Gregory of Tours made him one os the seventy
disciples of our Lord, and asserted that he had been sent to
Gaul by S. Peter. It was a debated point whether he should,
or should not, rank asan apostle, and his position in this Litany
implies the acceptance ol the legend embodied in the 9th or
10th century Acta, and the admission oi the claim which was
sometimes made on his behals to apostolic rank.

A lew words must be said upon the point (to which as
we have seen M. Pottier directs attention), os the insertion oi '
S. Etheldreda’s name in the Canon, together with that of S.
Gertrude.¹ Eventaken in conjunction with such prominence
as is given in other parts os the manuscript to the Ely saluta,
and to S. Etheldreda in particular, this insertion does not
appear by any means conclusive in favour oi M. Pottier’s
theory. We have to account ior the presence, not osone name,
but oi two: and the name of S. Gertrude is not that which we
should expect to find inserted along with that ol S. Etheldreda

Swithun, Ethelwold, and Judocl in the Litany ol the Visitation Order, and by a prayer
in the Burial Order, intended to be said in the church of the New Minster (aster the
body bas been carried to the neighbouring churches, and prayers have been said in
them) in which S. Judoc and S. Grimbald are mentioned.

² M. Pottier, in saying that these are the only unusual nemesin the Canon ol the
lumieges MS„ bas perhaps overlooked the iact that in the clause communicantes the
name oi S. George is inserted alter those of SS. Cosmas and Damian, and before those
of SS. Benedici, Martin and Gregory. A possible account os this matter is that the
text, in one oi the MSS. in the pedigree os the Jurnieges book, ran “Cosmae et
Damiani, Gregorii, Benedicti, Martini‚’' thatin an intermediate MS. ‘⁴ Gregorii ’⁹ has,
by a clerioal error, been converted into “Georgii'’ and that the consequent omission
oi S. Gregory’s name has been amended by its addition after that oi S. Martin, leaving
tbe clerical error as an integral partos the text. The mention oi S. Georgeis certainly
unusual, but in any case it can hardly throw light on the provenance oi the MS.
