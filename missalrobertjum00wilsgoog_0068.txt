ol S. Kenelm occurs in a tenth century English Sacramentary,
now at Orleans, which M. Delisle believes to proceed lrom
Winchcombe.¹ The mass ol' S. Genovesa seems to be sor the
most part taken from one included in the Commune Sanctorum
os Gem.; that ol S. Justus from the mass of S. Vitus; while the
mass sor the Translation os S. Martin has supplied the Presace
sor the Translation of S. Ethelwold. We have already seen
that the masscs os S. Vcdast, S. Omer, and S. Augustineof
Canterbury are in close agreement; they havc probably found
their way into the text os Gem. from different sources having
themselves a common source. Some ol the masscs os English
Saints are marked by features of style which suggest that, is not
the work ol a single hand, they are at any rate the product os a
single school. The use ol rather unusual words, and a certain
turgidity of expression, which arc perhaps most distinctly to
be scen in the mass ol S. Etheldreda, may be sound also in
the masscs of S. Eormenhild, S. Ethelwold (Kal. Aug), thc
Translation os S. Swithun,and in the Presaces os S. Oswald
and S. Botulf. It must be admitted that as a whole the masscs
oi English origin do not compare t'avourably with the more
restrained and statcly forms derived srom the older Sacra·
mentaries.

The Comrrrune Sanctomm of Gem. is rather fuller than
that of Leos. A, and still more so than that os (Mur), which
provides no masscs sor vigils. Men. provides a smaller number
os masscs than Gem., but has attached to each mass a number
os alternative prayers Gem. employs in the Common ol
Apostles masscs nearly agreeing with some assigned to
particular days· in the Proprium. That sor the Vigil osone
Apostle corresponds to the mass for the Vigil ol S. Andrew‚²
that sor the Festival to the mass sor S. Andrew's Day.³ The
messes sorthe Vigil and Festival of several Apostles similarly

Leofr. C sor the Invention of S. Stephen, but neither agrees with the mass in Gem.
(Lcesric lllr'ssal pp. 208, 252).
