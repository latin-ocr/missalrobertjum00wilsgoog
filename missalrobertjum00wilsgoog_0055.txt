INTRODUCTION. xlix

Gem. varies the order of the prayers Ad Vespemm, nd Fontes
and Ad S. Andream on the Thursday. On the Octave‚ Gem.
omits the prayers Ad Vesperum and Ad Fontes, which appear in
Mur. Men Leofr. The series of Aliae Orationes paschales in
Gem. is shorter than that of the other three Gregorian books,
nor are the few prayers included in it placed in the same order
as in Leofr. or Mur. The series in Men. differs a good deal
from all the others

For the four Sundays which follow Gem. has masses agreeing
with those in Leofr. except in the absence of a Super Populum:
as regards the prayers Mur. agrees with Gem., while Ott.
supplies the same Prefaces which appear in Gem. Leofr.‚ and
Men. in each mass agrees with Gem. and Leofr. in respect of the
Collect and the Preface.

The Rogation Days arc not recognised in Mur. But leofr.
Gem. Men, which provide for them, employ for the first the
prayers and the mass which appears in Mur. for the Lr'tanru
Major on Apr. 25. Leofr. and Gem. preserve this date and the
title Lr‘tanz'a Major. Men. has the title Litania Major, but not
the date: it differs from the others in the Secret of the mass.
Leofr. provides a mass for the Tuesday different from thatin
Gem. and also from that in Men. Men. and Gem. have masses
also for the chnesday‚ but these do not agree, except as
regards the Preface. Men, it may be remarked has for each
of the days a series of prayers for the procession, before the
mass. The masses for the Tuesday and Wednesday which
appear in Gem. are chiefly made up of prayers found in the
series of “ Orationes pro Peccatis ’' in (Mur), but include one or
two Gelasian collects. The Prefaces for all three days are
found in Ott, which apparently places the Rogation Day
masses, (as Litania Major) according to the date of April 25,
and before the third Sunday after the Octave of Easter.¹

For the Vigil of the Ascension, again, there is no mass in

¹ The Secret of the Tuesday mass is that of a Gelasian mass “in tribulatione ’'
found in V and R. (See Mur. Lu. Rom. u'er.i.c01. 70⁶.) That of the Wednesday
massis in V aniR in ι mass “pro peste animalium,'’ and hus a similar ploce iu
(Mur.) see Muratori, Lr't. Rom. Vct. i. 715, ii. 205.
