lNrRthtcrlotu lxix

The Orationes in Agenda Mortuomm and the order of the
Burial ol' the Dead differ from thc parallel section ol the Leoiric
Missal, though both contain, as might be expected, a consider-
able proportion of common material. In this section ol the
Jumieges manuscriptthereare agood many forms which occur in
one or other ol the Gelasian Sacramentaries V and R, and the
same may be said os the series of masses ior the departed, some
ol' which differ from those os the Gelasian V only in the absence
oi a second Collect,and a special Hancrgr‘tun and in the presence
oi a proper Preface. There are, naturally, some resemblances
also to the series oi masscs in the Leosric Missal and oi
Muratori’s Sacramentary, but the series as a whole does not
agree with either of these.

Oi the five masses pro vr'vis atquc defunctas four occur in the
leofric Missal, the first three in the original part oi the Sacra-
mentary (thesecond being twice repeated, with some variations,
among the additions) ; thc fourth, with a Preiace not contained
in the Jumieges book, is also among the contents ol Lcofr. C.

The mass pro sacerdotibus with which the Sacramentary ends
is not found as a whole in the Leolric Missal; but thc prayer
which serves as its Collect occurs, with some variation, among
other additions of the later hands in that manuscript.¹ This
mass surnishes the only instance in the Jumieges book ol the
Epistle and Gospel being written out at length. ln some other
messes in the latter part oi the book thcy are indicated by
their first words; but even this is rare.

The inscription on the last lcas os the manuscript is repro·
duced in Plate XV. It will seen that its first paragraph, so lar
as appears from its wording, seems to have been written by
Robert ol Jumieges himself, while still Bishop oi London. The
second portion is also worded in the first person: and it may
perhaps be thought that the apparent differencc in the hand·
writing of the two parts, noticed elsewhere,¹ is sufficiently
accounted sor by the supposition that the last lines were added,
