Collect for the same day. Men. has only one Sunday mass,
agreeing with that for the second Sunday 'in Gem. The

Prefaces for both Sundays are in Ott
For the Vigil of the Epiphany Mur. provides no mass.

That in Leofr. has no Preface. Men. agrees with Gem.,
following R and S, which differ frorn V only in the Preface.
Ott. has the same Preface with Gem. Leofr. Men.¹ ln the mass
for the festival Gem. and Ott. have the same Preface which
appears in R and S, and also agree with these Gelasian books
in employing for the first Sunday after the festival the Pre-
face which in Leofr. Mur. Men. belongs to the festival itself.

Men. repeats this Preface on the first Sunday, and Gem. directs
its use also on the Octave. fn the masses for the six Sundays
after the Epiphany, Gem. has always a Super Populum, agreeing
in each case with R and S. These rnasses in (Mur.) have no
Super Populum, Leofr. has none for the first Sunday, while Men.
has none for the fourth, and for the fifth and sixth has forms
different from those in Leofr. and Gern.¹ The Prefaces for
these Sundays in Gem. are arranged in an order rather different
frorn that in Ott. Men. Leofr., the Prefaces for the third and
fourth Sundays being exchanged. Leofr. differs from the
others in using for the first Sunday the Preface which Gem. and
Ott. employ for the festival. ¹

The masses for Septuagesima and the two Sundays which
follow are all in agreement with Mur. with the addition, in each
case, of the Preface found in Ott. ln (Mur.) the only Preface
for these days is that for Quinquagesima The corresponding
masses in Leofr. differ frorn those in Gem. only by the presence

¹ Two variatione of reading in this mass are perhaps worthy of special mention.
(a) In the Secret V has ut eune praesentibus sacrifieiis immolemur et sumamus, and
uirh this R S and laeofr. agree. Men. substitutes u! praesentibus illi for ut eum
praesentibus. Gem. reads cum for euru. (b) ln the Preface V (which has this Preface
for the p'estival) reads iudex puerpera virginalis stella, and S r agrees. R has puer·
perae, S 2 puerperr'e'; Men. Otr. omit puerpera virginalis and insert Damim'cae
apparitionis before iudex. Genu also inserts Damiuuae apparitionis but reads
perpetua for puerpera, connecting virginalis with stella.

² For the sixth Sunday Meu. (as often) employs as Super Populum one of the
prayers which in R and S appear as Colleets
