xx , INTRODUCTION.

dissolution of the monastery in 1791, when it passed to the
Public Library of Rouen, where it is still preserved. At Ronen
it seems to have been at one time known as “the book of
S. Guthlac,¹’¹ but its modern binding bears the title “Missale

Roberti Cantuar. Archiepiscopi.'’ lts present press·mark in the
Rouen Library is 1' 6.

The manuscript, which is a fine specimen of English writing
and illumination, has been several times described.⁸ lt nowcon·
tains 228 numbered leaves, measuring very nearly 13} inches
by 81 inches. The last leaf, numbered 228, whic'h contains
the record ol Robert’s gift, is independent of the preceding
gathering.

The leaves from iol. 1 to iol. 227 are arranged in 31 gather-
ings. without signatures. The collation, summarilystated, is as
follows:

Α4 B C D⁸ (D 5, 6, 7, 8 wanting), E⁸ (E 1, 2 wanting),
FG 11⁸ 1⁶ (I 3 wanting), Κ8 1⁰ (L 6 being an inserted
leal), 11¹⁰ N O P Qu (Q 4 wanting), R S T U X Y Ζ8 (ι’
b⁹ (b 1 being an added leaf), cdcsg⁸ Ιιί (lt 4 wanting).

ll'ith regard to the lost leaves, it seems most likely that those
missing from the gatherings D and E were blank leaves, four at
the end ol the section containing the Kalendar and Paschal
Tables, and two at the beginning ol the first gathering of the
Sacramentary proper. The leal missing from the gatheringlr
was also probably a blank leaf. ln the gatherings l and Q part
os the text has unfortunately been lost, and in each os these
cases it seems likely that the missing portion of the text was
written on the recto ol the missing leaf, while the verso was
occupied by an illumination. lt seems probable that a leaf has
