INTRODUCTIOM xxrv

abbess of Dereham‚ notos Ely.¹ Her connectionwith Ely was
apparently due to the translation of her relies to that 'house in
974, after the destruction of Dereham hythe Danes. lt is
perhaps only natural that in th‘e Litany of any Benedictine
house in southern England some representatives of Ely should
find mention: and it is also natural that the mention of any one
of a group of saints so closely connected as these four should
bring with it the names os the others. At New Minster, as we
have seen, there were perhaps special reasons for the veneration
of saints connected with Ely: and the presence of these four
names therefore seems hardly sufficient to support M. Pottier's
theory. lndced, there are some other names in the Litany of
the manuscript the presence of which seems more in need of
explanation. S. Eormenhild’s name is followed by that of S.
Petronilla, and hers again by those of three other English
saints, S. Cyneswith S. Cyncburga and S. Timba.² These
saints, like those of the former group, were connected together
by ties of kindred: and just as the former group of names has
been used as evidence of a connection between the manuscript
and the monastery oi Ely, so this group might be used as
evidence connecting it with the monastery of Peterborough.
Such a conjecture may be supported also by the distinction
given in the Kalendar to the name os S. Tibba‚³ and by the fact
that the Litany includes, in the list of martyrs, the name of S.
Florentinus, who is probably to be identified with the S. Floren-
tinus or Florentius whose relies were venerated at Peterborough.
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (according to the text of the
Bodleian MS. Laud 636) records the translation to Peterborough‚
on one and the same day, of the relies os S. Cyneswith‚ S.
Cyneburga‚ and S. Tibba. The same tcxt also records the
translation to Peterborough in 1013, of the relies os S. F loren-
tinus‚ by the abbot Aelfsi, who had purchased them frorn the

¹ M. Pottier has apparently identified her with her ltinswoman S. Werhurga, who
was the fourth abbess of Ely.

² S. Timba (or Tibba) is the only one of these three whose name appears in the
Kalendar of the MS.
