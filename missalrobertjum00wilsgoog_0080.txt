lxxiv NOTE.

third is the Preface for the feast of SS. Timotheus and symphorianus, which
does not agree with the Preface of either of the two masses for the day in
the Jumieges MS., but follows mutatis mutandis the Preface for S. Hermes
in the Jumieges hook. The mass of S. Hermes in the Havre MS. has no
Preface. Similarly the Preface for the feast of S. Agapitus (xv. Kal.
Sept.) in the Jumieges MS. is transferred with a change of name to
the mass for the feast of S. Magnus (xiv. Kal Sept.) in the Havre MS.,
which has no Preface in the mass of S. Agapitus.

The Prefaces of the Commune Sanctorum in the Havre book differ from
those of the Jumieges hook in the majority of cases. The series of votive
masses were apparently assigned to the same days of the week in the two
books¹ That in the Havre MS. is imperfect, and it is not impossible that it

included a massin memoriam Salvaton‘s like that on p. 241 infra But if
it contained such amase it must have been placed differently from that in
the Jumieges bools One of the five Prefaces of these votive masses which
remain in the Havre MS. differs from that of the corresponding mass in the

Jumieges boole

¹ The mass ad suffragia angelorum is placed in the Havre MS. before thet pro
putatoribus [l pccatrkk but the headings given by M. Fierville show dm the first of
the two was assigned to Tuesday, the second to Monday.
