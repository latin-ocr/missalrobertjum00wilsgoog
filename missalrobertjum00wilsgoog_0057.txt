agree except in the Preface. Leofr. also agrees with Gem.
but adds a Super Populum. The Preface of Gem. and Leofr.
is also in Men. and Ott.¹ For Pentecost and the three days
which follow the prayers of Gem. arethe same as those of Mur.
Leofr. and Men. (save for the presence in the last two of some
additions): the Prefaces are the same as in Ott.⁹ Men. Leofr.
The case is the same with the mass for the Friday. For the
Thursday‚ Mur. supplies no mass. Here Gem. employs the
prayers of the mass which in S. is given as an alternative for
that of the Vigil of Pentecost, and which is marked byS 2for
use infra lubdomadam. The Preface of Gem. Leofr. Men. is the
same as that of Ott.

The prayers of the Sabbatum iu xii Lectionibus are almost
the same in all the four books. Leofr. omits one of the prayers
before the Collect of the mass, and Men. has a Secret differing
from that of the others. The Preface in Gem. Leofr. Men.
agrees with Ott. For the Sunday following, Gem. Leofr. Men.
all discard the mass which appears in Mur. The two former
agree in adopting the prayers and Preface of the Gelasian books,
omitting the first two collects of the mass as it stands in
V‚⁸ while Gem. also omits the Super Populum. The Prcface
appears also in Ott and Men.

The Sundays which follow are reckoned in Gem. as the first,
second, &e after the Octave: Leofr. reclrons them as the
second, third, &c after Pentecost, and in this rechoning Men.
(which places the corresponding masses apart, after the
Couunuue Sanctorum) and Ott. agree. ln (Mur.) they are
counted as the first, second, &c after Pentecost, the “ Dominica
vacat ’' of Mur. being left out of the rechoning both at the
beginning and in the middle of the series. For our present
purpose, it will be unnecessary to refer continually to this
differenee: we may consider that the first Sunday after
Pentecost in Mur. is the same as the first Sunday after the
Octave in Gem.

¹ lt is the Preface of the alternative mass in V and S.
² Mur. has only the l'refnee for Pentecost.
⁸ ln 1< and S the second Colleet of V is omitted.
