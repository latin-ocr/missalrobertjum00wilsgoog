liv INTRODUCTION.

Leolr. and Gem. are in agreement not only in these Sunday
masses ol Advent, but also in the masses provided for the
Ember Days. Gem. does not provide a Super Populum in any
os the masses save that lor the first Sunday. Leofr. has one on
each os the first three Sundays, that on the lirst Sundaydiffering
srom the one in Gem. The masses in Mur. have no Super
Populum: the other prayers agree with Leolr. and Gem. Men.
differs slightly lrom the other books throughout this section.
lts Prelaces. however, agree with those ol Leolr. and Gem. in all
the masses except that lor the Wednesday. In (Mur.) there
are two Advent Prelaces of which Leolr. Gem. Men. employ
one sor a Sunday, and one lor the Ieium'um mensis decimi, which
Leolr. and Gem. adopt for the Wednesday. The Prelaces ol Ott.
here agree throughout with those os Leolr. and Gem. But Otr
has also a lew Advent Prelaces ‘⁴ quotidianis diebus ’⁹ : and among
these occurs the Prelace which Men. employs lor the first ol the
Embcr Days. The series ot* additional prayers sor Advent in
Gem. does not exactly agree with that in Leolr. Men. or Mur.
Most ol the forms which it contains are lound in Mur. Two or
three which do not appear in Muratori's text occur in the
Gelasian books.

The T errporale ol Gem. ends with selections ot' prayers
entitled “Pro pcccatis,’' “Quotidianis diebus,'' ‘¹ Nocturnale5,''
‘¹ Matutinales,’' “Vespertinales.'' The prayers os the first two
sets all appear in similar, but fuller, series in (Mun). The
“ Matutinales ”and “ Vespertinales,'' with one exception,¹ are in·
cluded in the similar selection in (Mur.)¹; the “Noctumales.''
⁴ with one exception, are lound in a second series os “Matuti-
nales ” also contained in (Mur.).³

As regards the T corporale, the general results of this
comparison may be summed up as follows :-

1. That the most marked differences between Leolr. and

Gem. occur in cases where Mur. provides no mass ior
a particular day, or where (as in the Sundays aiter

ζ 'lhis one prayer is apparently included in the parallel series in Ott.
