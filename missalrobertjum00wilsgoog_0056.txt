l INTRODUCTION.

Illur.1 Leolr. and Gem. each have one, agreeing sor the most
part with the mass which Men. provides lor the Wednesday—
sor the same day, that is to say, under another aspect. All
three are derived, apparently lrom the Gelasian books, but with
slight variatione. Leolr. and Men. take as the collect the first,
while Gem. takes the second, ol the two Collects ol the Gelasian
mass¹3 all three take the Secret and Postcommunion, and
Leolr. also the Super Populum. Gem. differs from Leol'r. and
Men. in employing lor the Vigil the Presace which in Mur.
Leosr. Men. is assigned to the festival, while the other two have
the Prelace os the same Gelasi'an mass lrom which they have
taken the prayers. For the festival, Gem. and Ott. have this
same Prcsace, while Leolr. and Men. agree with Mur. The
prayers are alike in all sour, save that Gem. adds a Super
Populum, taken lrom the Gelasian booles.l

For the Sunday alter the Ascension Leolr. Men. and Gem.
agree with (Mur.) in the Collect, Secret, and Postcommunion.
They agree with Ott not with (Mur), in the Prelace. Each
ol thern adds another prayer to those in (Mur), the addition
having in Gem. the heading Ad vesperum, in Leolr. Super
Populum, in Men. Alia. The added prayer in Leolr. is the
Super Populum os the mass in R and S, while Gem. and Men.
adopt the second Collect ol the same mass.

The lessons and prayers os the Vigil of Pentecost as given
in Gem. are only in partial agreement with the series in Mur.
but the tracts are indicated, as on Easter Even; one prayer os
the series in Mur. is omitted, and also three ol the “Aliae Ora·
tiones ’¹ which in Mur. follow the prayer referring to the tract
Sicut ceruus. But the agreement with Mur. is closer than in
Leolr. or Men.⁴ In the mass which sollows Gem. and Mur.

¹ See Matalon, Lr't. Rom. Vel. ii. 317.

² The massin question is in S the first ol two messes sor the Ascension. R marks

itas lor the Vigil. All the contents of this mass ol R and S appear in one or other oi
the two masses ol the Ascension which are contained in V. (See llluratori, Lu. Rom.
Ver. i. 87-9.)
³ Itsis in V the first Collect ol the first os the two massas, in S and R the second
collect of the second mass. There is a slight variation ol reading in Gem. (celebranda
or declaranda.)
