force as an indication ol date, is the omission ol the name ol
S. Alphege He had been Bishop oi Winchester before he
became Archbishop, and we might therefore expect to find him
commemorated at Winchester earlier than in most localitics.
His sanctity seems to have been recognised within a very sew
years lrom his death in 1012, while his remains still lay in
London: and alter his translation in 1023 some mention os 'nis
name might be confidently expected in any Kalendar belonging
to the south oi England, and not least in a Winchester manu-
script.

Thus lrom the evidence ol the Kalendar and the Proprium
it seems most likely that the manuscript was written after the
year 1008 ; it seems probable that it was written before the end
os 1023. The suggestion os a date between 1013 and 1017 has
less sure ground. lt depends, for the later limit‚ on the
inference from the absence os any mention os the obits of
Ethelred and Edmund “ Ι ronside ’³ z sor its earlier limit‚ on the
fact that the mention ol S. Florentinus in the Litany pro

irfirrrrzlc is most easily accounted for if we regard the manu-
script as having been written in or aster the year 1013. This
point will be discusscd further in considering the evidence as to
locality,¹ which is the next subject ol our enquiry.

For determining the place at which the manuscript was
written we find in the book itsels evidence os two kinds. The
illuminations with which it is adorned areos a peculiar type,
which is found in a small number of English manuscripts, and
is believed to mark the work of what is called the Winchester
school. lt would be possible, on the evidence os the illumina· ’
tions alone, to assign the manuscript with some confidence to
one ol the two great monasteries os Winchestcr, and to decide

Kalendar-Ethelrcd on S. George's day, Edmund on S. Andrew's day, in 1016.
There is, however, in each case sufficient space ior a note ol the obit, il the scribe

had chosen to add such a note in the Kalendar.
