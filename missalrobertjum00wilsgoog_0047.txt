i. First may be mentioned the Gregorian Sacramentary

published by Muratori in the second volume of his
Liturgia Romana Vetus. ln this text it will some-
times at least be desirable to distinguish between three
distinct portions :-

(a) The part os the text which extends in Muratori's
edition from col. 1 to eol. 138. For this po‘r·
tion, which may be regarded as representing
the Gregorian Sacramentary in the form in
which it was received from Rome by Charles
the Great in the latter years ol the eighth een·
tury, the abbreviation Mur. will be employed.

(b) The second partos Muratori's text, extending
lrom col. 143 to col. 290, may be regarded as
representing the supplementary matter com·
piled by Alcuin, and added to the Roman
Sacramentary already mentioned, with the
object os adapting it sor general use.¹ This
portion ol the text will be denoted by the
symbol (Mur).

(c) The portions of the text (and some additions
given in mot-notes) which Muratori extracted
from the Codex Ottobonianus, will be denoted
by the symbol Ott. This section, lilre the last,
is probably in the main derived from Alcuin's
supplement to the Roman Sacramentary.

ii. The Leofric Missal, now in the Bodleian Library at
Oxlord, edited by the Rev. F. E. Warren. ln this
manuscript the matter ol the Roman Sacramentary
and os Alcuin's supplement are lused together: but
here again it may be desirable to distinguish between
different elements included in the book. The main ’

’ body ol the manuscript is, Μτ. Warren tells us, os the

rhun, and independent of, that included in Alcuin's compilation.
