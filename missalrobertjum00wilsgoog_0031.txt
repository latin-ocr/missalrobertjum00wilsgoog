certainly shows the book to be later than 988, the year 01 the
saint's decease. 11 may point to a date alter 1033, the year in
which the observance 01 the festival is said to have been enjoined
by the law ol Canute.l But it is most likely that the saint was
commemorated, especially in monastic churches‚ within a very
lew years from the time 01 his death. Again, the presence in
the Proprium (or rather in the additions to the Proprium con·
tained in the leaves which precede the Kalendar) 01 two masses
ol S. Edward‚ and the importance given in the Kalendar to the
festival of his martyrdom‚2 probably indicate a date later than
1008, in which year the “Witan ’' decreed the observance 01 his
festival on March 18 throughout England.⁸

Ou the othcrhand it is to be noted that neither the Proprium
nor the Kalendar contains any mention 01 S. Alphege, and that
while the dates 01 the deaths 01 King Edgar and his son S.
Edward are marked in the Kalendar,⁴ there is no note 01 1110
obitos Ethelred or 01 Edmund ·‘ Ironside.’' lt is 01 course true

that there was a special reason lor the mention 01 S. Edward:

and it may be said also that while the memory 01 Edgar would
be honoured in the monasteries 01 winchester, 01 which he was
a benefactor, there was possibly no great desire to keep alive
the memory os Ethelred, and Edmund “Ironside” was 1101
acknowledged as King in Wessex. Yet the absence 01 any note ·.
ol events which might be taken tomark not only the sailure 01 , ,,
0ne lineos Kings, but also the successive stages ol Canute’s
power, is perhaps significant.³ More notable‚ and 01 111010

The date 01 1033 is that assigned by Wilkins. Carrcr'lr'a Magnae Britanniae et
Hibermae, vol. i. p. 299. The festival is not marked in the Kalendar 01 the
Jumieges MS.

² The day is marked in the Kalendar by gold uncial letters, an ornament which,
so lar as a distinction can he drawn, probably indicates that the lestival was regarded
as 0110 01 high rank. Even allowing 1ο1 the honour which might be given 10 a royal
saint, this would hardly have been the cade while the veneration 01 the saint was still,
so to say, tentative and local.

This decision 01 the “Witan’' is rehearsed, or reenacted, 111 the Law 01 Canute
already referred to.

Edgar is noted 011 8July, alter the mention 01 S. Grimbald.
