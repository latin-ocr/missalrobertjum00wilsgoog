monks oi Bonneval, in the diocese of Chartres.¹ For the trans-
lation of S. Cyneswith and her companions no date is given,
but it seems most likely that this event toolr place within a few
years of the translation of S. Florentinus.¹ Thus all these

saints had been, so to say, brought into prominence within a
very short time before the date which has been assigned as the

latest probable date of the Jumidges MS. Their translations
may very possibly have given a temporary impulse to their
cultus in other Benedictine communities‚ as well as at Peter·
horough itsels ; and it may be that this is the cause of the
appearance of their names in the Litany. But if the presence
os their names be taken in connection with the absence of the
names of saints locally venerated at Winchester, it must be
allowed that there is good reason for suspecting that, as regards
this portion of its contents, the Jumieges MS, although written
at Winchester, has followed a text used at Peterborough.³

¹ S. florentinus is supposed to have suffered martyrdom near Autun, but the place
of his death has been disputed. So has also the place where his relies were really
deposited. But the monastery of Bonneval appears to have claimed them, and to have
recognised him as its patron. According to the Angla-Saxon Chroniclc, the moniis,
while selling the body of the saint for five hundred pontida, retained possession of his
head. A.-S. Chrom'clc, ed. Thorpe (Rolls Series) vol. i. pp. 272-3, or vol. ii. p. 96.

⁸ The translation is recorded in the Angla-Sam chronice under the year 963.
But it is quite clear that the writer is speaking of things which happened after that
date, anticipating the history of the ablrots of Peterborought and he ascribes the
tmnslation to Aelfsi, who became abbot in 1006. it is not unlilrely that it toolr place
after the destruction by the llanes, in or alrrut 1010, of the monastery of Castor,
where SS. Cyneswith aud Cyneburga were originally buried.

³ This suspicion is strengthened by a comparison of the last leaves of the Jumiiges
MS. (from fol. 207 onwarrls) with the contents of the corresponding portion of
tlre fragment of a Winchester Sacramentary found by the Rev. F. F. Warren
in the Chapter Library at Worcester Cathedral, and described by him in the Aradaemy
of Dec. ιι, 1885. This fragment, which is oi a date but little later than that
assigned to the Jumiiges MS, no doubt proceeds from Winchester, and there seems
no reason to ‹poestion the correctness of Mr. Warren’s view that it was intended
