lw the Public Library ot' Havre is preserved a portion of a Missal
apparently written about the year molor use at Winchester.¹ The
Prel'aces of this book have been made known by M. Ch. Fierville, in a
paper published hythe Socim Haoraise Mardos diverses. They are 190 in
number, 50 belonging to the Temporale‚ 121 to the Proprium, 14 to the
Commune Sanctorum, and the rest to votive masses.

ln regard to the Temporale it may be noted that the Havre MS. has
only one Rogationday l'relace3 that the Pret'aces sor the Vigil and the
Festival of the Ascension have the sume positions as in the Leolric Missal,
so differing lrorn the order os the Jumieges MS.; and that there is no
proper Presace t'or the Sabbatum in rv't' lectionibus alter l‘entecost. The
Sundays aster Pentecost are numbered from the Festival (not, as in the
Jumieges MS, from the Octave) : but the Presaces sor the most part agree
with those sor the corresponding Sundays in the Jumieges boolc That
which the Jumieges MS. assigns to the 25th Sunday aster the Octave
appears in the Havre MS. sor the Sunday aster l'entecost (apparently as· an
alternative to the l’ret'ace de S. T rr‘rritate): that which the Jumieges book
employs sor the 22nd Sunday alter the Octave is assigned in the Havre book
to the 25th Sunday alter Pentecost: the Prelaces lor the 23rd and zrth
Sundays aster Pentecost in the one book are the same as those sor the
23rd and 24th Sundays alter the Octave in the other: and the Havre MS.
hes Pret'aces t‘or the 26th and 27th Sundays after Pentecost which are not in
the series of the Jumieges book.

Out ot' the 121 Presaces oi the Propn'um Sanctorum extracted by
M. Fierville from the Havre MS. 70 have the same position as in the
Jumieges book3 21 are lor days for which the Jumieges book provides no
proper mass 3 13 are lor days lor which the Jumieges book has a mass but
provides no proper Preface²t the remaining 17 ditl'er lrom the correspontling
Prelaces ol the Jumieges boole

Ol these 17 two are the Presaces lor the Vigil and Festival ol S. Peter,

which have reversed the positions given to them in the Jumieges MS. Α

¹ The pnvename ol the MS. issufficiently clear from the number of Winchester
Sninu commemorated in the Proprirtm Summam. There are three Ptesaces os
S. Jeme, und one ol S. Grimlrald, a laet which may suggest that the lmolr belonged
to the New Minster, or Hyde. The Kelenclar is unfortunately lost.

¹ Tln't number includes a Prelece assigned in M. Fiervillc’s pnper to the least ol
SS. Proteum and Martinianus (vi. Non. Jul.): but thc Presace uppenrs nnlly to belong
to the seen ol the Translntion ol S. Martio, two days later. Isso, the number os
thie clus should be dininished, end that ol the next cluss increosed to 18.
