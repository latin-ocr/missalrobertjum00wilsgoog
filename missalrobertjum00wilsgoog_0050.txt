same which appear in Leoir. On the other hand Leoir, like
Men, generally provides an Episcopal Benediction, 3ηά these
are entirely absent from Gem.¹

ln the Christmas masses, with which the T emporale begins,
it may be noticed that Gem. (contrary to its general usage)
retains the mention oi the Roman churches in the headings of
the several masses. In the mass of the Vigil, Gem. agrees with
Leosr. Men. Ott. in providing a Preface, which is not in Mur.
ln the first mass oi the festival it agrees with Mur. in respectos
the Preface, while Leofr. Men. Ott have the same Preface as the
Gelasian books, which Gem. employs ior the third mass, where
Mur. Men. Ott. Leosr. agree in using the same Preface which
Mur. has ior the first. The series of Aliae Orationes in Gem.
includes two prayers which are absent from the parallel series
in Mur. Leolr. Men. but appear in the Gelasian books, the first
in V and S as a Collect in the mass oi the Vigil, the second in
V R and S among the Aliae Orationes.

The mass os Gem. sor Jan. 1 ( Octavus Domine) is not in Mur.
and differs srom that in Leosr. by the addition os a Collect ad
Vesperum, which is not the same as the Supm Populum in Men.;
but except ior the heading oi this prayer, sor the absence os a
second Collect, and sor the exact lorm os the Prelace, the mass
in Gem. agrees with the Gelasian books The Prelace is nearly
irr the form given by S 2, which abridges the older Gelasian
Preface, and agrees with Leoir. and Ort ln Men. the Preface
is still further abridged.

The masscs ior the two Sundays aiter Christmas in Gem.
agree with Leosr. and (Mur.) except that (Mur.) has no Presaee,
and neither Leofr. nor (Mur.) has a Super Populum. The Super
Populum sor the first Sunday in Gem. agrees with R and S,
that for the second Sunday iu Gem. is in R and S the second

¹ These Benedictions would naturally be omitted in a manuscript written sor use in
a monastery where they were not employed. ln some ‘¹ mitred '' abbcys, the abbot
had the privilege oi using this formos Benediction : but the privilege ‹lid not belong to
all ‘⁶ mitred '¹ abbots, and its extension to abbots was probably at least unusual at the
date when the Jumieges MS. was written. The use oi such Benerlictions by Bishops
in England at or before the date oi the manuscript is attested by the Benedictionals oi
S. Ethelwold and oi Ethelgar.
