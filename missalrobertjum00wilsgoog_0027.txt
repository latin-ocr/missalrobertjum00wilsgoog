also been lost between fol. 173 (=Z 8) and fol. 174 (= a 1).
The leaf numbered 176 is now attached to the gathering b, and
is reclroned as part of that gathcring in the collation given
above: but it seems not unlilrely that the garthering a originally
consisted of four leaves, of which fol. 176 was the fourth, the
first leaf, separating the Sanctorale from the Votive nasses,
being either altogether blank, or more probably having on its
verso (facing the ornamented first page of the Votive Masses)
some adornment which led to its removal and to the detaclr·
ment, in consequence, os fol. 176. lt may be noted that the
first four leaves contain some masses supplementary to the
Proprium Sanctorum. Fol. 5 seems to have been at some time
detached, and to have been restored to its place.

Many of the masses contained in the book are distinguished
by having their first words written ln gold. ln the case of some
os the principal festivals further distinction is given by the
presence of one or more full-page illuminations preceding the page
on which the mass begins. Thus the mass In Natali Domini ad
S. Petrum is preceded by two illuminations (see plates 1 and
11) that of the Epiphany by two (see plates 111· and IV) that
In nocte sancta by four (see plates v-V1111) those of the
Ascension, Pentecost, and the feasts of SS. Peter and Paul,
All Saints, and S. Andrew, each by one (see plates 1x-X11117.
ln those cases where there is only one illumination the whole of
the first page of the mass is written in gold, within an orna·
mental border: and this is the case also with the mass of
the Purification and with the mass de sancta T rinr‘tate which
begins the series of Votive Masses.² Several other masses have
their first words written in gold, but are not distinguished by
borders or illuminations.³ To this class belong the mass of the
first Sunday of Lentos the feasts of S. Stephen‚ S. John, the

¹ The order of these plates is not exactly that ol the illuminations in the MS.

² These are two of the places where there is reason to suppose that a leaf has been
removed. The mass of Palm Sunday is less highly ornamented: but it is possible
that here also a miniature hasbeen lost.

³ In cases where the whole of the first page of the mass isin gold the characters
employed are uncial for the heading and first words. and minuscule for the rest of the
prayers Where only the first few words are in gold the characters are capitale.
