real test of locality, we shall find that, with very few exceptions,
the names of saints supplied by the Kalendar and the Proprium
Sanctorum of our MS. may be divided into two groups. One of
these consists of names belonging to England, the other of

names connected with adistrict including the north of France,
the March of F landers, and part of Lower Lotharingia Within
each of these groups, again, we may find evidence of a more
precise kind, in the prominence given to certain names, either by
the ornamentation given to them in the Kalendas, or by the
presence of proper masses in the text. We may first take the
saints of the English group, marking with an asterislc those
festivals which appear in the Kalendar, and with an “obelus ”
those for which the book provides special masses. The few titles
printed in italic type indicate that the masses are to be found,
not in the body of the book, but in the leaves at the beginning
of the volume.

Various parts of England are represented in this list, but the
prominence of those especially connected with Winchester is
clearly marked. Three festivals of S. Swithun are noted, two of
